        Bihar has one of the most prominent pilgrimages at Gaya for imparting offerings to ancestors. Ramayana and
        Mahabharata, the grand epics of India which are still extremely popular and connected to Hindu religion have
        numerous tales associated with various places in Bihar. The author of Ramayana, Valmiki also belonged to this
